# Mood Tracker Application 
This app helps you to stay attuned to your feelings, because everyone knows that all the things that you’ve done depends on your mood
It works like a personal diary, which means that you can take notes daily, and then share them with your doctor or just analyze by yourself
Each day at 21:00 it sends a notification like: “How did you spend time today? How was your mood? ” etc.
